/**
 * Helps to distinguishes an initial first attempt from a rety.
 * <p>
 * If is used by uplinks like {@link sirius.biz.storage.layer3.uplink.ftp.FTPUplink} or {@link SFTPUplink} to
 * permit a retry for all IO related operations. Therefore the helper method {@link #shouldThrow(Exception)}
 * can be used to determine if an <tt>IOException</tt> is swallowed if it occurs during a first attempt but
 * will be thrown during a retry.
 * <p>
 * The pattern to use this looks something like:
 * <pre>{@code
 * for(Attempt attempt : Attempt.values()) {
 *     try {
 *         ...do something
 *         return;
 *     } catch(Exception e) {
 *         if (attempt.shouldThrow(e)) {
 *             throw Exceptions.handle...
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * This approach permits to perform inner returns and also enables some optimizations to the compiler (as opposed to
 * use lambdas).
